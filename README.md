1) Deploy Static Resources using AWS Amplify Console:-

Task: Deploy the frontend of the web application using AWS Amplify Console.
Details:
Set up AWS Amplify Console for continuous deployment from a code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
Configure Amplify to build and deploy static resources as HTML files.
Ensure the web app is accessible via a public URL provided by Amplify.

2) Build a Serverless Function using AWS Lambda:-

Task: Develop a serverless backend function using AWS Lambda.
Details:
Write a Lambda function in a supported language (e.g., Node.js, Python).
Implement the business logic required by the web application.
Set up the Lambda function to handle requests and responses efficiently.

![2) Build Serverless Function-AWS Lambda](https://github.com/abolishinde2124/Architect-and-Build-an-End-to-End-AWS-Web-Application/assets/142035465/3c2a4364-27df-46e9-8f11-3115f9075d50)

3) Link Serverless Function to Web App using API Gateway:-

Task: Deploy the serverless function and make it accessible through an API.
Details:
Create an API in Amazon API Gateway to expose the Lambda function as a RESTful endpoint.
Configure routes and methods to handle HTTP requests (e.g., GET, POST).
Ensure secure access to the API by configuring appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.

4) Create Data Table using Amazon DynamoDB:-

Task: Persist application data using Amazon DynamoDB.
Details:
Design a DynamoDB table schema to store necessary data for the application.
Implement the required read/write operations in the Lambda function to interact with the DynamoDB table.
Ensure efficient data access patterns and scalability.

7) Add Interactivity to Web App:-

Task: Modify the web application to interact with the API and provide a dynamic user experience.
Details:
Update the frontend code to make HTTP requests to the API Gateway endpoint.
Handle responses from the serverless function and update the UI accordingly.
Implement features such as form submissions, data retrieval, and real-time updates to enhance user interactivity.

Outcome:-
The completed web application will:-
Hands-on experience with AWS Amplify for frontend deployments.
Building and deploying serverless functions with AWS Lambda.
Configuring and managing APIs with Amazon API Gateway.
Designing efficient data schemas and interacting with DynamoDB.
Enhancing web app interactivity with API integrations.

This hands-on project was a fantastic opportunity to deepen my understanding of AWS services and their seamless integration to create modern web applications. ðŸŒŸ
